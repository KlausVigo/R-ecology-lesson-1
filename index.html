<p>This is a an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in 3/4 of a day. They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data.frame, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, and finish with how to calculate summary statistics for each level and a very brief introduction to plotting.</p>
